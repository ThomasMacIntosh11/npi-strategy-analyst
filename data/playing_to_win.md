# Playing to Win Framework

## Overview

Playing to Win is a strategic framework developed by A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin. It defines strategy as a set of integrated choices that position an organization to win in its chosen markets.

## The Five Key Choices

### 1. Winning Aspiration

**What it is**: Your organization's purpose and desired impact. Not just goals, but your fundamental reason for being.

**Key Questions**:
- What does "winning" mean for us?
- What impact do we want to have on customers, employees, and stakeholders?
- What would make us uniquely valuable?

**Characteristics of Good Aspirations**:
- Inspiring and motivating
- Focused on creating value, not just capturing it
- Provides clear direction for decision-making
- Ambitious but achievable

**Examples**:
- "Be the most recommended payroll education provider by professionals"
- "Empower payroll professionals to become strategic business leaders"
- "Transform payroll from compliance to competitive advantage"

### 2. Where to Play

**What it is**: The specific markets, segments, geographies, and channels where you choose to compete (and explicitly choose NOT to compete).

**Key Questions**:
- Which customer segments will we serve?
- Which geographies will we compete in?
- Which products/services will we offer?
- Which channels will we use?

**Dimensions to Consider**:
- **Customer Segments**: Size of organization, industry, sophistication level
- **Geography**: National, regional, provincial
- **Product Scope**: Certification, training, consulting, tools, content
- **Channel**: Direct, partnerships, digital platforms, in-person

**Making Choices**:
- Be explicit about what you will NOT do
- Avoid trying to be everything to everyone
- Choose based on where you can uniquely win

### 3. How to Win

**What it is**: Your competitive advantage and value proposition. How will you create more value than alternatives?

**Key Questions**:
- What unique value do we provide?
- Why would customers choose us over alternatives?
- How do we create sustainable differentiation?

**Two Primary Strategies**:
- **Cost Leadership**: Lowest total cost to deliver value
- **Differentiation**: Unique value that commands premium or preference

**For Associations/Education**:
- Superior content quality and relevance
- Unique delivery model or experience
- Network effects and community
- Brand and credibility
- Integration and ecosystem

**Testing Your How to Win**:
- Is it distinctive? (Would competitors say the same?)
- Is it defensible? (Can it be easily copied?)
- Is it valued by customers? (Will they pay for it?)

### 4. Core Capabilities

**What it is**: The set of activities and competencies that enable your strategy. What you must be great at to win.

**Key Questions**:
- What must we be distinctively good at?
- What capabilities are table stakes vs. differentiating?
- Should we build, buy, or partner for each capability?

**Categories of Capabilities**:
- **Functional**: Marketing, technology, operations, finance
- **Process**: Product development, customer service, innovation
- **Knowledge**: Subject matter expertise, market insights
- **Relational**: Partnerships, networks, ecosystem

**Prioritization**:
- Focus on 3-5 core capabilities
- Invest disproportionately in differentiating capabilities
- Be "good enough" in table stakes
- Partner for non-core needs

---

### 5. Management Systems

**What it is**: The structures, measures, and processes that support strategy execution.

**Key Questions**:
- What metrics will we track?
- How will we allocate resources?
- What governance and decision rights do we need?
- How will we build the right culture?

**Key Management Systems**:
- **Performance Metrics**: Leading and lagging indicators aligned to strategy
- **Resource Allocation**: Budgeting and investment priorities
- **Talent Management**: Recruiting, development, compensation
- **Governance**: Decision-making processes and accountability
- **Culture and Values**: Behaviors and norms that support strategy

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Using generic metrics not tied to strategy
- Organizational structure doesn't support strategic priorities
- Incentives reward old behaviors, not new strategic direction
- Culture conflicts with stated strategy

## Using the Framework

### Integration is Key
The five choices must reinforce each other. Each choice narrows the possibilities for the next, creating a coherent, integrated strategy.

### Cascading Choices
Playing to Win applies at multiple levels:
- Corporate: Overall organization strategy
- Business Unit: Strategy for specific divisions or offerings
- Functional: How each function supports the strategy

### Strategic Coherence Test
Ask: Do all five choices reinforce each other? If you changed one choice, would you need to change the others?

### Example of Coherent Strategy

**Aspiration**: Be the most trusted advisor for payroll professionals in strategic industries

**Where to Play**: 
- Finance, healthcare, and tech sectors
- Companies with 100-5000 employees
- Canada-wide, with emphasis on major metros

**How to Win**: 
- Industry-specific expertise no one else has
- Peer learning and networking at the core
- Premium positioning

**Capabilities**:
- Deep industry SMEs and content
- Community building and facilitation
- Strategic advisory methodologies

**Management Systems**:
- Metrics: Member satisfaction, renewal rate, referrals
- Resource allocation: 60% to content, 30% to community
- Culture: Expert advisors, not order-takers

## Workshop Application

Use this framework to:
1. **Test current strategy**: Do we have clear answers to all five choices?
2. **Identify gaps**: Where are our choices unclear or conflicting?
3. **Generate options**: What are alternative sets of choices we could make?
4. **Evaluate tradeoffs**: What would we gain/lose with each option?
5. **Build consensus**: Align the team on integrated choices

Remember: Strategy is about making hard choices, not trying to do everything. The power is in explicitly choosing where NOT to play and how to focus resources for maximum impact.
